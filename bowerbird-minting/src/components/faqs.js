						<div className="faq-qa">
							<span className="faq-question">How do I buy a BOWERBIRD NFT?</span>
							<p>BOWERBIRD NFTs will be available to mint in the coming weeks. We will post details ahead of time on our <a href="https://discord.gg/bowerbirds" target="_blank">Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BowerBirdsNFT" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. After the mint is over, you will be able to trade BOWERBIRD NFTs on OpenSea.</p>
						</div>

						<div className="faq-qa">
							<span className="faq-question">How much will the BOWERBIRD NFT's cost?</span>
							<p>The cost of the BOWERBIRD NFTS mint will be determined 24 hours before it goes live. This will not be your ordinary cheap NFT mint from an anonymous team. When getting a BOWERBIRD NFT, youâ€™re essentially getting <strong>3 NFT sets</strong> for the price of one, as holders will get <strong>FREE</strong> mint to our next two NFT's, among many other benefits.</p>

						<div className="faq-qa">
							<span className="faq-question">How many BOWERBIRDS will be available?</span>

							<span className="faq-question">How many BOWERBIRDS can I mint?</span>
							<p>The exact number of BOWERBIRD NFT's a single person can mint will be determined and disclosed in our <a href="https://discord.gg/bowerbirds" target="_blank">Discord</a> 24 hours before launch.</p>
						</div>

						<div className="faq-qa">
							<span className="faq-question">Why should I hold a BOWERBIRD?</span>
							<p>Buying a BOWERBIRD NFT and holding will lead to a series of future NFT's. The first (Male) BOWERBIRD NFT will be matched with a FEMALE BOWERBIRD 3 to 4 weeks after the collection is sold out. Holding the first two NFT's will produce the third NFT, a BOWERBIRD EGG. This combination leads to higher utility activations, future NFT Art Drops and benefits in the <a href="https://discord.gg/bowerbirds" target="_blank">Discord community</a>.</p>

							<span className="faq-question">When can I see my NFT after I purchase?</span>
