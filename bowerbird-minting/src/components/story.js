							    	<h5>The Land</h5>
									<p>Somewhere in Phoenix AvR. [more Augmented Virtual Reality - less Arizona]</p>
									<p>It is a mysterious land located in the back of your mind where wild things are found tending to peaceful groves of artistic curation and gallant exploration.</p>
									<p>A land seemingly baron at first glance, devoid of lush pasture yet flowing with rivers rich for discovery that offer plentiful rewards to those watchful - first moving (minters) who act with a mix of deft curiosity and true belief.</p>
									<p>Many have travelled far and wide, some from across the Open Sea in imaginative craft harnessing any manner of natural forces. Others have left the safety of home, travelling on foot and by means of other transportation devices, facing struggles and trials that have left arterial pathways scattered with those too weak to go any further. Most folk with hands of mere papyrus, who could hold no longer.</p>
									<p>This land is a place best not journeyed alone. A place where travel security rests solely on ones ability to team up with the most cunning of companions. A land where it pays dividends of extreme proportion, to be ever vigilant of the Black Swan, that mythic beast, that devastating tormentor. A creature you never want to cross your path. Ever.</p>

									<h5>The Museum</h5>
									<p>At the peak of this mysterious land, perched high on a remote mountain top, way, way, way above the desolate stretch of the valley below, there stands a structure, a grand architectural expression of monolithic proportions.</p>
									<p>The building known only as the "Hover" - is a museum of rare and exquisite NFT works of art.</p>
									<p>This spellbinding structure, built single handedly by the Great Hover Bird, representing his life's work, was eons in the making. The Hover Bird had been beaten back by many a storm, but never ever beaten down completely.</p>
									<p>Weathering all that life's rich tapestry had thrown his way, he lived, breathed and stayed true to the his passion, crafting away at the ever expanding Hover - a task he see's as unending.</p>
									<p>Now after all this time, the Hover floats majestically above the desolate wasteland below, waiting for the Great Gathering of all the Bower Birds innately drawn like trout upstreaming, to this most illuminated chamber.</p>
									<p>The "Hover" a thing of beauty within itself, showcases great NFT collections from those who have travelled far across the Metaverse to mingle, exhibit and trade with other like minded cove. At it's heart - a collective.</p>
									<p><em>The Bower Bird Collective.</em></p>

									<h5>The Protagonist</h5>
									<p>Meet the male Bower Bird a collector, artist and rambunctious architect at heart.</p>
									<p>In his many travels, he has had to face much danger along this formidable path from the likes of NFT fakes and frauds, failed transactions, exorbitant gas fees, not to mention those late night regrettable decisions that "seemed like a great buy at the time". Yes our hero bears all the hallmarks of a seasoned journeyman.</p>
									<p>True to his Bower Bird traits, though being a careful curator and thoughtful exhibitor of his prized art collection, there is buried deep within his core, a strong desire to attract a mate, <em>the female Bower Bird</em></p>
									<p>This mysterious and rarely seen female of the species, shares his common attraction to all manner of art with interests spanning from  the great art movements of antiquity to the contemporary artists of more modern times. Together they share a special respect for the genius of artists like Picasso, Salvador D'Ail, Van Gough, Warhol, Banksey to name but a few.</p>
									<p>And now to matters at hand, the male Bower Bird is constantly rearranging his Bower to make sure his collection has just the right mix, in order to impress a potential mate. But are his endeavours emphatic enough to attract his elusive muse?</p>
									<p>And so the story of the Bower Bird Collective begins...</p>
